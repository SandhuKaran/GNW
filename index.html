              <p class="review-text">We had our backyard redone by Greenworks Landscaping and Manee was incredible. He
                was professional, not at all pushy, and took the time to explain exactly what was going to be done.
                Throughout the process I could see him and his team working with great care, diligence, and focus. They
                layered every step with precision, starting with a 10-inch excavation, installing landscape fabric,
                adding layers of HPB and compacting each one, then carefully placing the pavers and concrete to make
                sure the edges stayed secure. He also took extra steps to ensure proper drainage.

                Manee was so accommodating, really great with communication, and always replied shortly after receiving
                a message. He was happy to answer my questions without making me feel like I was bothering him. He and
                his team transformed an almost unusable backyard that had an old deck, was full of flagstone, tree and
                bush stumps, two large trees, and tons of thistle into a huge, beautiful patio where my kids can ride
                their bikes and play. We wanted our backyard to be a huge patio while keeping the trees in the back for
                shade. The back left of our backyard also had a catch basin to receive run off from the surrounding
                houses. Since the makeover, they have wanted to be outside every single day.

                The team also cleaned up so well, and all of this was done for a great price. We can’t thank Greenworks
                Landscaping enough for the incredible job they did. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for
                landscaping work. We will definitely be hiring Greenworks landscaping for any future landscaping work
                that needs to be done!!!!

              <p class="review-text">I really cannot say enough amazing things about Manee and his crew!!

                So, firstly, let me say that communication is a big factor for me and my husband; Manee had his
                responses so quick and friendly. He was really great to communicate with and his prices were very
                reasonable.

                It's just impossible to find people that are willing to work and that are thorough. They made our place
                look so fabulous, and it took only 2 days.

                They re-mulched all of our flower beds and did it with such a level of tidiness and accuracy. They also
                cleaned up each day, and when they left for the night they put road cones down be safe so no one would
                run over the product.

                Manee is a very personable guy and it's a real pleasure chatting with him. He has a great vision of how
                things will come together and is also very reassuring.

                The men on his crew worked incredibly hard, and we just went through a very hot spell. We kept offering
                them water and asked if they needed anything.

                I really enjoyed working with Greenworks Landscaping and I will definitely refer my neighbours to them.

                So because we live on a corner house and our place is the first house coming into the neighborhood, it's
                important for us to have great curb appeal into our neighborhood....so thank you Manee for nailing this!

                A perfect 10/10!!!

                His score on Google should be 5⭐...not 4.9

                Thanks again!!!!</p>

                project, but Manny and his team made the process easy from start to finish. They completely transformed
                our yard in just a week and a half, even working through a holiday weekend to get it done. Manny was
                professional, patient with all of my questions, and offered fantastic suggestions throughout the
                planning process. His crew worked efficiently, paid close attention to detail, and the finished product
                exceeded our expectations. We couldn’t be happier and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for
                quality landscaping work!</p>

                close attention to the overall design and placement of each piece of stone. Manee made several
                recommendations along the way and we are very happy with the final result. We highly recommend GNW for
